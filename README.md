# discord-js-bot
  A discord bot that doesn't do much, for now. It has some basic commands, a singleplayer mastermind game and a two-player tic-tac-toe game.
<br><br><b>Command list: </b><br><br>
  Every command should be of the form: <i>>command</i>
- <b><i>ping</i></b>: answers with pong;
- <b><i>speak</i></b>: gives a random line from The Bee Movie from a JSON;
- <b><i>say ...</i></b>: says what you tell it to say;
- <b><i>encourage</i></b>: gives a random wholesome encouraging message from a JSON;
- <b><i>tictactoe @...</i></b>: starts a tic-tac-toe game with the tagged user;
- <b><i>mark ... ...</i></b>: in an on-going tic-tac-toe game, marks the position that has the given coordinates;
- <b><i>mastermind</i></b>: starts a mastermind game;
- <b><i>guess ...</i></b>: in an on-going mastermind game, guesses the number;
- <b><i>commands</i></b>: returns the commands list.

Planning on adding more minigames.
